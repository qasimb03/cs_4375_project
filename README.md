# Step-by-Step Guide to Running the RNN Program

Follow these instructions to set up and run the program:
## 0. Check if Python 3 is installed

cd .\cs_4375_project\
```
Linux/Mac:
```bash
cd /cs_4375_project/
```

## 3. Create a Python Virtual Environment and Activate

Windows:
```bash
python -m venv <venv_name>
<venv_name>\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install required libraries
```bash
